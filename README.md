# ExODBCTest

This module is intended for development and experimentation purposes only.  The goal is to investigate the viability of connecting to MariaDB Server using Connector/ODBC from Elixir through Erlang ODBC.

Initial investigation shwos that it is possible, but the lack of documentation for Erlang ODBC module necessitates exploration and further testing.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `exodbctest` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
